      <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-6">Last updated: 07/04/2024</p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        This Know Your Customer ("KYC") Policy outlines the procedures and practices employed by 
        <strong>TONIX.PRO</strong> ("Company", "we", "us", or "our") to verify the identity of our users and to 
        monitor their activities on the TONIX platform ("Platform"). Our commitment to preventing fraud, money 
        laundering, terrorist financing, and other illegal activities is paramount. As such, this KYC Policy has 
        been established in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, and it is designed to ensure that 
        the TONIX platform remains a secure and compliant environment for all users.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-base font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">1. Purpose and Scope of the KYC Policy</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The primary purpose of this KYC Policy is to establish a comprehensive framework that governs the process 
        of verifying the identity of users on the TONIX platform. This policy is intended to prevent the misuse 
        of our services for illicit activities, including but not limited to money laundering, fraud, and terrorist 
        financing. This policy applies to all users of the TONIX platform, irrespective of their location or the 
        nature of their transactions. Compliance with this KYC Policy is mandatory, and continued use of the TONIX 
        platform signifies acceptance of and adherence to these procedures.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-base font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">2. Legal and Regulatory Compliance</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        TONIX.PRO is committed to complying with all applicable laws, regulations, and guidelines pertaining to 
        KYC, anti-money laundering ("AML"), and counter-terrorist financing ("CTF"). This includes but is not 
        limited to the provisions set forth by the Financial Action Task Force ("FATF"), the European Union’s 
        Anti-Money Laundering Directives, and other relevant national and international regulatory bodies. The 
        Company reserves the right to update or amend this KYC Policy as necessary to ensure continued compliance 
        with legal requirements and best practices.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-base font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">3. KYC Verification Process</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The KYC verification process at TONIX is designed to establish the true identity of each user and to 
        ensure that the information provided by users is accurate and up-to-date. The verification process is 
        tiered, with different levels of verification required based on the user’s activity on the platform.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Step 1: Basic Verification</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Basic verification is required for all users upon registration on the TONIX platform. This initial step 
        involves the collection of fundamental personal information, including but not limited to:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>Full legal name</li>
        <li>Date of birth</li>
        <li>Nationality</li>
        <li>Residential address</li>
        <li>Contact information (e.g., email address, phone number)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Users are required to upload a clear, legible copy of a government-issued identification document (e.g., 
        passport, national ID card, or driver’s license). The document must be valid, unexpired, and must clearly 
        display the user’s full name, date of birth, and photograph. This step is essential to confirm the identity 
        of the user and to ensure that the account is being operated by the rightful individual.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Step 2: Enhanced Verification</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Enhanced verification is mandatory for users engaging in higher-value transactions or utilizing specific 
        features on the TONIX platform. This step includes the following additional requirements:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>
          Submission of a recent utility bill, bank statement, or similar document that serves as proof of address. 
          The document must be issued within the last three months and must display the user’s full name and 
          residential address.
        </li>
        <li>
          A photograph of the user holding their government-issued ID next to a handwritten note containing a 
          unique code provided by TONIX during the verification process. This photograph must be clear and legible, 
          with all details visible.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Additionally, the information provided by the user during this step will be cross-referenced with external 
        databases to confirm its accuracy. This enhanced verification is critical for ensuring the legitimacy of 
        the user’s activities on the platform and for mitigating the risk of fraudulent transactions.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Step 3: Source of Funds Verification</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">
        For users conducting transactions that exceed specific thresholds, TONIX requires verification of the source 
        of funds. This step is necessary to ensure that the funds being used on the platform are derived from legitimate 
        sources and are not associated with criminal activity. Users may be required to provide one or more of the 
        following documents:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>Bank statements showing the origin of the funds</li>
        <li>Proof of business ownership (e.g., business registration documents, tax returns)</li>
        <li>Employment records or pay stubs</li>
        <li>Inheritance documents</li>
        <li>Investment portfolios or asset ownership records</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The documentation provided must clearly demonstrate the origin and legitimacy of the funds. In cases where the 
        documentation is deemed insufficient or unclear, TONIX reserves the right to request additional information or 
        clarification. Failure to provide satisfactory evidence of the source of funds may result in the suspension or 
        termination of the user’s account.
      </p>

      <!-- Repeat similar structure for other sections of the policy -->
