# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization and
# are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other than
# English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t "hello"
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t("hello") %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more about the API, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.
#
# Be aware that YAML interprets the following case-insensitive strings as
# booleans: `true`, `false`, `on`, `off`, `yes`, `no`. Therefore, these strings
# must be quoted to be interpreted as strings. For example:
#
#     en:
#       "yes": yup
#       enabled: "ON"

      employed by TONIX.PRO ("Company", "we", "us", or "our") to verify the 
      identity of our users and to monitor their activities on the TONIX 
      platform ("Platform"). Our commitment to preventing fraud, money laundering, 
      terrorist financing, and other illegal activities is paramount. As such, this 
      KYC Policy has been established in accordance with applicable laws and 
      regulations, and it is designed to ensure that the TONIX platform remains 
      a secure and compliant environment for all users.
    items:
      item1:
        title: "Purpose and Scope of the KYC Policy"
        body: >
          The primary purpose of this KYC Policy is to establish a comprehensive 
          framework that governs the process of verifying the identity of users on 
          the TONIX platform. This policy is intended to prevent the misuse of 
          our services for illicit activities, including but not limited to money 
          laundering, fraud, and terrorist financing. This policy applies to all 
          users of the TONIX platform, irrespective of their location or the nature 
          of their transactions. Compliance with this KYC Policy is mandatory, and 
          continued use of the TONIX platform signifies acceptance of and adherence 
          to these procedures.
      item2:
        title: "Legal and Regulatory Compliance"
        body: >
          TONIX.PRO is committed to complying with all applicable laws, regulations, 
          and guidelines pertaining to KYC, anti-money laundering ("AML"), and 
          counter-terrorist financing ("CTF"). This includes but is not limited to 
          the provisions set forth by the Financial Action Task Force ("FATF"), the 
          European Union’s Anti-Money Laundering Directives, and other relevant national 
          and international regulatory bodies. The Company reserves the right to update 
          or amend this KYC Policy as necessary to ensure continued compliance with 
          legal requirements and best practices.
      item3:
        title: "KYC Verification Process"
        body: >
          The KYC verification process at TONIX is designed to establish the true identity 
          of each user and to ensure that the information provided by users is accurate and 
          up-to-date. The verification process is tiered, with different levels of verification 
          required based on the user’s activity on the platform.
        steps:
          step1:
            title: "Step 1: Basic Verification"
            body_1: >
              Basic verification is required for all users upon registration on the TONIX platform. 
              This initial step involves the collection of fundamental personal information, including 
              but not limited to:
            ul:
              li_1: "Full legal name"
              li_2: "Date of birth"
              li_3: "Nationality"
              li_4: "Residential address"
              li_5: "Contact information (e.g., email address, phone number)"
            body_2: >
              Users are required to upload a clear, legible copy of a government-issued identification 
              document (e.g., passport, national ID card, or driver’s license). The document must be 
              valid, unexpired, and must clearly display the user’s full name, date of birth, and photograph. 
              This step is essential to confirm the identity of the user and to ensure that the account is 
              being operated by the rightful individual.
          step2:
            title: "Step 2: Enhanced Verification"
            body_1: >
              Enhanced verification is mandatory for users engaging in higher-value transactions or utilizing 
              specific features on the TONIX platform. This step includes the following additional requirements:
            ul:
              li_1: >
                Submission of a recent utility bill, bank statement, or similar document that serves as proof 
                of address. The document must be issued within the last three months and must display the user’s 
                full name and residential address.
              li_2: >
                A photograph of the user holding their government-issued ID next to a handwritten note containing 
                a unique code provided by TONIX during the verification process. This photograph must be clear 
                and legible, with all details visible.
            body_2: >
              Additionally, the information provided by the user during this step will be cross-referenced with 
              external databases to confirm its accuracy. This enhanced verification is critical for ensuring 
              the legitimacy of the user’s activities on the platform and for mitigating the risk of fraudulent 
              transactions.
          step3:
            title: "Step 3: Source of Funds Verification"
            body_1: >
              For users conducting transactions that exceed specific thresholds, TONIX requires verification 
              of the source of funds. This step is necessary to ensure that the funds being used on the platform 
              are derived from legitimate sources and are not associated with criminal activity. Users may be 
              required to provide one or more of the following documents:
            ul:
              li_1: "Bank statements showing the origin of the funds"
              li_2: "Proof of business ownership (e.g., business registration documents, tax returns)"
              li_3: "Employment records or pay stubs"
              li_4: "Inheritance documents"
              li_5: "Investment portfolios or asset ownership records"
            body_2: >
              The documentation provided must clearly demonstrate the origin and legitimacy of the funds. 
              In cases where the documentation is deemed insufficient or unclear, TONIX reserves the right 
              to request additional information or clarification. Failure to provide satisfactory evidence 
              of the source of funds may result in the suspension or termination of the user’s account.
      item4:
        title: "Customer Identification and Verification"
        body: >
          The formal identification of customers is a fundamental requirement of the KYC process. This involves 
          the submission of government-issued identification documents as outlined above. TONIX utilizes both 
          manual and automated processes to verify the authenticity of the documents and the accuracy of the 
          information provided by users. All submitted documents must be clear, unaltered, and legible, with 
          all relevant information visible. Any attempt to provide falsified or fraudulent documents will 
          result in immediate account suspension and may be reported to the appropriate authorities.
      item5:
        title: "Proof of Address"
        body: >
          Proof of address is required as part of the enhanced verification process. Acceptable forms of proof 
          include recent utility bills, bank statements, or government-issued documents that display the user’s 
          full name and residential address. The document must be issued within the last three months and must 
          be clear and legible. TONIX reserves the right to reject any documents that do not meet these criteria 
          or to request additional documentation if the proof of address is deemed insufficient.
      item6:
        title: "Risk Management and Compliance"
        body_1: >
          TONIX employs a comprehensive risk management framework to identify, assess, and mitigate 
          potential risks associated with different user profiles and geographic regions. Users are 
          categorized into different risk levels based on factors such as the volume and frequency 
          of transactions, the user’s location, and the nature of their activities on the platform. 
          Depending on the risk level, additional verification steps may be required, and the thresholds 
          for triggering enhanced verification may be adjusted accordingly.
        body_2: >
          High-risk regions may be subject to stricter KYC procedures, and in some cases, users from 
          certain jurisdictions may be prohibited from accessing the TONIX platform entirely. 
          TONIX continuously monitors the risk landscape and updates its policies and procedures 
          to address emerging threats and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.
      item7:
        title: "Ongoing Transaction Monitoring"
        body_1: >
          Ongoing transaction monitoring is a critical component of the TONIX compliance program. All 
          transactions conducted on the platform are subject to continuous review to detect and prevent 
          suspicious activities. TONIX utilizes advanced algorithms and data analytics to identify 
          patterns that may indicate fraudulent behavior, money laundering, or other illegal activities. 
          Transactions that deviate from a user’s established behavior profile are flagged for further 
          investigation.
        body_2: >
          In addition to automated monitoring, our compliance team conducts manual reviews of transactions 
          to ensure that any potential red flags are addressed promptly. Users may be contacted to provide 
          additional information or clarification regarding specific transactions. Failure to respond to 
          such requests may result in account restrictions or closure.
      item8:
        title: "Reporting of Suspicious Transactions"
        body: >
          TONIX is committed to cooperating with law enforcement and regulatory authorities in the 
          fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. Any suspicious transactions identified 
          through our monitoring processes will be reported to the relevant Financial Intelligence 
          Unit ("FIU") in accordance with legal obligations. TONIX also reserves the right to suspend 
          or terminate the accounts of users involved in suspicious activities and to take any additional 
          actions deemed necessary to protect the integrity of the platform.
      item9:
        title: "Record Keeping"
        body: >
          TONIX maintains comprehensive records of all KYC-related documentation, transaction data, and 
          user interactions. These records are retained for a minimum of ten years following the end of 
          the business relationship or the date of the transaction, whichever is later. All records are 
          securely stored and protected using industry-standard encryption and access control measures. 
          TONIX ensures that all records are readily accessible for compliance audits and regulatory reviews.
      item10:
        title: "Data Protection and Privacy"
        body: >
          The protection of user data is a top priority for TONIX. All personal information collected during 
          the KYC process is handled in accordance with our Privacy Policy and applicable data protection 
          laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"). Users have the right to access, 
          correct, or delete their personal data, subject to certain legal and regulatory requirements. 
          TONIX implements robust security measures to safeguard user data from unauthorized access, 
          disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

        title: "Employee Training and Awareness"
        body: >
          TONIX invests in the ongoing training and education of its employees to ensure that they are 
          fully equipped to manage KYC and AML responsibilities. All employees involved in KYC and compliance 
          activities receive regular training on the latest regulatory developments, best practices, and 
          emerging threats. This training is designed to ensure that our team can effectively identify and 
          respond to potential risks, and that they are familiar with the legal and ethical obligations 
          associated with their roles.
